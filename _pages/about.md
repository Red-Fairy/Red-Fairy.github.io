I'm a final-year undergraduate from the [Turing class](https://cfcs.pku.edu.cn/english/research/turing_program/introduction1/index.htm), [School of Electronics Engineering and Computer Science](https://eecs.pku.edu.cn/), [Peking University](https://www.pku.edu.cn/). My research interest is to enable machines perceive, understand, interact with, and learn from the 3D world and I'm currently interested in 3D object-centric learning and generation.

I'm currently an undergraduate visiting researcher ([UGVR](https://engineering.stanford.edu/students-academics/programs/global-engineering-programs/chinese-ugvr)) at [Stanford University](https://www.stanford.edu/), supervised by [Prof. Jiajun Wu](https://jiajunwu.com/). Before that, I am honored to be advised by [Prof. Jiaying Liu](http://39.96.165.147/people/liujiaying.html) and [Prof. Yisen Wang](https://yisenwang.github.io/).

I'm actively looking for a Ph.D. position starting from Fall 2024. :smile:
